### ⚠️ Note

Due to differences in how the Matter standard is implemented across smart home platforms, **the same Matter device may appear and behave differently in each ecosystem**. This includes but is not limited to:

1. **Tunable White Bulb - Color Temperature Not Synced.**
   When the color temperature of a tunable white bulb is changed, the updated value is not properly reflected in the Apple Home app.

2. **RGB Bulb - Color Changes Not Synced.**
   After changing the color of an RGB bulb, the updated color is not synchronized correctly to the Apple Home and Google Home apps.

3. **Device Status Not Updated in Real-Time.**
   In Alexa and Google Home apps, device status doesn't update automatically when the device is controlled from other platforms. You need to manually refresh the device list or open the device details page to view the current status.

4. **Brightness Percentage Offset for Lights.**
   In the SmartThings app, the brightness percentage displayed for lighting devices is consistently around 1% higher than the actual brightness level.

5. **Curtain Position Percentage Reversed Across Platforms.**
   Curtain open-percentage is interpreted differently across platforms. For example, a curtain showing as 30% open in Alexa would appear as 70% open in Apple Home, SmartThings, and Google Home.

6. **Devices Not Showing Up After Re-sync in SmartThings App.**
   If a previously synced device is removed and later re-synced, it may fail to appear immediately in the SmartThings app. Restarting the SmartThings Hub is necessary to resolve this issue.
