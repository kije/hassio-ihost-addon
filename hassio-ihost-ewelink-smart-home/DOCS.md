# eWeLink Smart Home

## 1. Introduction

**eWeLink Smart Home** is designed to replace the legacy [eWeLink Smart Home](https://github.com/CoolKit-Technologies/ha-addon). It allows you to integrate devices under your eWeLink account into **Home Assistant** via **MQTT**, enabling device control and automation directly within Home Assistant. Simply log in with your eWeLink account to sync your devices into Home Assistant.

The legacy [eWeLink Smart Home](https://github.com/CoolKit-Technologies/ha-addon) add-on will **no longer be maintained or updated**. Some of its entity implementations rely on deprecated approaches, and the new project provides more robust and future-proof device support.
If you are currently using the old add-on, don’t worry — the new add-on includes a **data migration feature**. After migration, your existing devices and automations in Home Assistant will continue to work as before. Please refer to **Step 5** for the migration process.

---

## 2. Key Differences Between the New and Legacy eWeLink Smart Home Add-ons

1. The new add-on provides **more entities** for devices synced to Home Assistant, with implementations that better align with Home Assistant standards. It will continue to expand support for more devices and capabilities, including rapid support for new SONOFF products.
2. The new add-on **does not provide a UI for device control**. All control and automation are performed directly within Home Assistant.
3. The new add-on **no longer supports syncing Home Assistant devices back to the eWeLink cloud**, a feature that existed in the legacy add-on.

---

## 3. Prerequisites

1. MQTT integration and the **MQTT Broker add-on** are installed and enabled in Home Assistant.
2. You have registered an **eWeLink account** and added devices via the eWeLink mobile app.
3. **If you are using the legacy eWeLink Smart Home add-on and wish to migrate its data**, please first upgrade it to **version 1.4.6**, then stop the legacy add-on. During migration, the system will automatically stop the legacy add-on if it is still running. Refer to **Step 5** for details.

---

### 4.3 About MQTT Configuration

We provide additional MQTT configuration options to accommodate users who rely on third-party MQTT brokers.
If you are not using a third-party MQTT broker, simply enable the add-on.
Once enabled, it will automatically start Home Assistant’s official Mosquitto broker and connect using the default credentials. No manual configuration is required. After successful startup, the add-on is ready to use.

---

### 4.4 Start the Add-on

After installation, click **Start** to launch the add-on. Please wait until the service has fully started before continuing.

## 5. Migrating Data From the Legacy eWeLink Smart Home Add-on

> If you do not need to migrate data from the legacy add-on, you may skip this section and proceed to **Step 6**.

### 5.1 **Important**: Upgrade the Legacy Add-on to Version 1.4.6

Return to the legacy eWeLink Smart Home add-on and upgrade it to **version 1.4.6**.

**Conflict Detection**

To prevent data inconsistency, the legacy and new eWeLink Smart Home add-ons **cannot run simultaneously by default**.
After upgrading, you will see a configuration option called **Conflict Detection**, which is enabled by default.

-   If disabled, both add-ons can run at the same time, but data consistency is **not guaranteed**.
-   This configuration is **not recommended**.

---

### 5.2 Log In to the New Add-on

Log in to the new eWeLink Smart Home add-on using the **same eWeLink account** as the legacy add-on.

1. Account login

---

### 5.3 Start Data Migration

After logging in, the system will automatically detect whether the same devices exist under both the new and legacy add-ons. If matching devices are found, you will be prompted to migrate data.

You may choose to migrate immediately or defer until the next login.

#### 5.3.1 Start Migration

Click **Migrate Now** to begin.
During migration:

-   Keep Home Assistant and the new add-on running.
-   Do not interrupt or close the process.
-   Home Assistant Core will be restarted once during migration.

#### 5.3.2 Stop the Legacy Add-on

To ensure data integrity, the system will automatically stop the legacy add-on.

If stopping fails (for example, if the legacy add-on is running in a standalone container), manually stop it and then return to the new add-on page and click **Stopped, Continue Migration**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kije/hassio-ihost-addon/refs/heads/master/hassio-ihost-ewelink-smart-home/images/stopping-addon.png)

#### 5.3.3 Migration in Progress

Once the legacy add-on has stopped successfully, data migration will begin automatically.
Home Assistant Core will restart once, typically taking **2–3 minutes**.

#### 5.3.4 Migration Completed

After a successful migration, devices previously added to Home Assistant via the legacy add-on will appear as **synced** in the new add-on.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kije/hassio-ihost-addon/refs/heads/master/hassio-ihost-ewelink-smart-home/images/migrate-complete.png)

#### 5.3.5 Cancel Migration

You may cancel migration at any time before it begins. After cancellation, logging out and back in will trigger the migration prompt again.

#### 5.3.6 Unexpected Exit

If you exit the new add-on UI or restart the add-on during migration, the migration process will **continue uninterrupted**.

---

### 5.4 Skip Migration

If you choose not to migrate, devices previously added via the legacy add-on will not be synced.
When syncing devices in the new add-on, **new devices and entities** will be created in Home Assistant.
