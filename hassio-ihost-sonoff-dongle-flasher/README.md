## About

SONOFF Dongle Flasher supports online firmware flashing for the iHost MG21 chip and the SONOFF Dongle series (ZBDongle-P, ZBDongle-E, Dongle-M, Dongle-PMG24, Dongle-LMG21 and Dongle-PZG23).

In addition to the SONOFF Dongle Flasher add-on, we also provide a [container version](https://hub.docker.com/r/ewelink/sonoff-dongle-flasher).

## Prerequisites

Before using the add-on, please make sure the serial port is not in use (it is commonly occupied by services like Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA).
During the firmware flashing process, the add-on will attempt to connect to the device and automatically check whether the serial port is occupied.
If it is, the add-on will try to stop the conflicting service for you.
